      Red chili powder is a spice made from dried and ground chili peppers. 
      It is a common ingredient in many cuisines around the world, including Mexican, 
      Indian, Thai, and Middle Eastern. Red chili powder is made from a variety of chili peppers, 
      which can vary in heat level and flavor. It is used to add heat and flavor to dishes such as curries, 
      stews, soups, sauces, and marinades. Red chili powder is also used as a seasoning for meats, vegetables, 
      and snacks such as popcorn and chips. The heat level of red chili powder can vary widely, 
      from mild and sweet to extremely hot and spicy, depending on the type of chili peppers used. 
      When using red chili powder in cooking, it is important to use it in moderation, 
      as a little goes a long way, and to taste as you go to ensure that the desired level of heat is achieved.
